simple producer-consumer problem
with conditional variable signaling

Main thread creates master thread.
Master thread divides matrix m * n
between worker threads such that
each worker works on the same number
of elements in each row (the last
worker may have them less). All
workers work on every row.
After each row has been populated
master copies the row to external buffer
and siignals workers to compute
next row.
